Create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. (in this case, 3000)

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. (in this case, it is)
